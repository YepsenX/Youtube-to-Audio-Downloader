You can use this script even if you don't know how to use python.

This guide is meant for anyone that isn't familiar with python and just wants to quickly figure out how to use the script.


Directions:

First, download & install python on your computer:
https://www.python.org/downloads/



After python is installed, you'll have to install pytube - which is the python module needed to interact with youtube. Get to your terminal emulator.

Windows Users:
Press the windows key + x, then tap i.

Mac Users:
Navigate to Applications/Utilities/Terminal

Linux & other OSs:
Anyone on a non Windows/Mac OS probably probably doesn't need these instructions or this guide. Ctrl+Alt+T

In your terminal, enter the command 'pip install pytube'



Download this script from github.
https://github.com/YepsenX/Youtube-to-Audio-Downloader/blob/main/YT%20to%20Audio.py

Click the "<>Code" button and select "Download ZIP"
Extract the file into a folder & right click 'YT to Audio.py' & open with Python.



You are now running the script. Follow the prompts.

A few FYI's follow.



Currently the script only works with playlist URLs. If you want to download an individual video, you'll have to add it to a playlist first.

For an easy way to get a save path, navigate to your disered folder in your file explorer. Right click on the folder at the upper middle bar of your explorer & select "copy address."

The script will most likely download the files as .webm or .mp4 file types. If you want a more common file type like .mp3 / .wav you'll have to convert it yourself after it downloads (eventually I might update the script to do this automatically). If don't have program which can play webm or mp4, I'd the FOSS VLC Media Player.

"The script says that only some of the total videos in my playlist are available!" This is a youtube thing. Region locked videos, or those that have since been privated, still count against the 'videos in playlist' even if you can't access them.

"The program said some videos were unable to be downloaded then showed me a bunch of urls." Unfortunatly, age restricted videos cannot be downloaded with pytube. Any videos that couldn't be downloaded AFTER the script scans your playlist will be listed as URLs when the script is finished. (Please save this list somewhere, the program will not currently hold onto this.)
