You can use this script even if you don't know how to use python.

This guide is meant for anyone that isn't familiar with python and just wants to quickly figure out how to use the script.


Directions:

First, download & install python on your computer:
https://www.python.org/downloads/



After python is installed, you'll have to install pytube - which is the python module needed to interact with youtube. Get to your terminal emulator.

Windows Users:
Press the windows key + x, then tap i.

Mac Users:
Navigate to Applications/Utilities/Terminal

Linux & other OSs:
Anyone on a non Windows/Mac OS probably probably doesn't need these instrions or this guide. Ctrl+Alt+T

In your terminal, enter the command 'pip install pytube'



Download this script from github.
https://github.com/YepsenX/Youtube-to-Audio-Downloader/blob/main/YT%20to%20Audio.py

Click the "<>Code" button and select "Download ZIP"
Extract the file into a folder & right click 'YT to Audio.py' & open with Python.



You are now running the script. Follow the prompts.

A few FYI's follow.



Currently the script only works with playlist URLs. If you want to download an individual video, you'll have to add it to a playlist first.

For an easy way to get a save path, navigate to your disered folder in your file explorer. Right click on the folder at the upper middle bar of your explorer & select "copy address."

The script will most likely download the files as .webm or .mp4 file types. If you want a more common file type like .mp3 / .wav you'll have to convert it yourself after it downloads (at least until I get around to patching in an automatic converter to the script). If don't have program which can play webm or mp4, I'd suggest VLC Media player as a FOSS.

"The script says that only some of the total videos in my playlist are available!" This is a youtube thing. If someone privates a video, it's regioned locked, or some other thing - it will still show up in your playlist even if you can't watch it. 

Age restricted videos are not able to be downloaded by this program. If these (or any other videos which are unable to be downloaded) exist in your playlist, the script will skip them & list the URLs which could not be downloaded when the entire playlist finishes downloading.
