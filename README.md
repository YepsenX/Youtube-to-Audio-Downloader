# Youtube-to-Audio-Downloader

If you are unsure about how to use this script, please consult the quick start guide.

This is a python script that uses pytube to download the highest quality audio stream possible from every video in a playlist.

Right now, it only works with playlists, and it will only download audio. I'll probably get around to making more options eventually, but for now this is what there is.
